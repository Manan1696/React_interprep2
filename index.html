    <h1>Day-2 React Interview Questions</h1>
    <h2>Q1. What is the Difference between react and react native? Which one is library or framework?</h2>
     <h2>React :-</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>React and React Native are developed by Facebook and have gained a huge fan base in a short time. React is known as ReactJs, which is a JavaScript library to build single-page web applications.</li>
      <li>React is a JavaScript library of reusable components designed to create skeletons of the apps.</li>
      <li>React is an open-source JS library for building the UIs for web applications</li>
      <li>React, originally developed by and still maintained by Facebook and supported by an active open source community, is in fact a JS 'library'. </li>
     </ul>
     <h2>React Native :-</h2>
     <ul>
      <li> React Native is a React JS-based framework to design mobile apps. Moreover, with reusable components, you can develop native mobile applications.</li>
      <li> React Native is designed to build native mobile apps with reusable components.</li>
      <li>React Native is used to build rich mobile UI from declarative components using only JavaScript.</li>
      <li>React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile applications for iOS and Android. </li>
     </ul>

    <h2>Q2. What is the package name you are using for routing?</h2>
     <p><strong>React Router DOM</strong> is an npm package that enables you to implement dynamic routing in a web app. It allows you to display pages and allow users to navigate them.</p>
     <hr/>
     
    <h2>Q3. Routing Implementation?</h2>
     <p>
        <strong>Step 1: Install react-router-dom  : </strong>
         npm install react-router-dom <br/> <br/>
        <strong>    Step 2: Importing react-router-dom in our project  :</strong>
         In the above code, we have wrapped our "App" component with "BrowserRouter" which enables us to use Html 5 history API. <br/><br/>
        <strong>Step 3: Implement Routing : </strong>
        In app.js we need to implement Routers cases with various routes.
        Each Route component needs two mandatory props and that is the path and the component to render.
     </p>

    <h2>Q4. How do you pass data from parent to child?</h2>
     <p>
       React.js allows us to use props (short form of property) to pass
       data from parent component to child component. We have to set props
       value inside the child component, while we embed it to the parent
       component.
     </p>
     <hr/>

    <h2>Q5. What is lazy loading in react?</h2>
     <p>Lazy loading is the technique of rendering only-needed or critical user interface items first, then quietly unrolling the non-critical items later. It is now fully integrated into core react library itself.</p>
   
     <hr/>

    <h2>Q6. Difference b/w stateless and Stateful Component</h2>
     <h2>StateLess</h2>
     <p>
     If the behaviour is independent of its state then it can be a stateless
     component. You can use either a function or a class for creating
     stateless components. But unless we need to use a lifecycle hook in your
     components, we should go for function components. There are a lot of
     benefits if you decide to use function components here; they are easy to
     write, understand, and test, a little faster, and you can avoid the this
     keyword altogether.
     </p>
    <h2>StateFul</h2>
    <p>
     If the behaviour of a component is dependent on the state of the
     component then it can be termed as stateful component. These stateful
     components are always class components and have a state that gets
     initialized in the constructor. class App extends Component{" "}
    </p>

   <h2>Q7. How do you switch one component to another, Conditional Rendering</h2>
    <p>
    Way to Switch/Navigate from one page to another page ,Link, NavLink,
    Redirect Component ,history.push, history.replace Link Link is used to
    manage the navigation and it worked as an anchor tag. Check below code
    for the demonstration. import "Link" from 'react-router-dom'; ... ...
    About NavLink NavLink behaves the same as Link but in addition, it comes
    with a new attribute called “activeClassName” which helps us to add the
    class to the anchor tag when page url will match. import "NavLink" from
    'react-router-dom'; ... ... About
